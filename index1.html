<ul>
<li>Cats are human's best friend! Even though they don't show it as much, they love us! Cats make the world a better place! 2 years ago, I adopted a small kitty and my life have changed. Now she is huge(I mean-huge!) and the queen of our life. Since then, I am leaving parties and any social event early to go home and see my little potato. I cannot describe how much I love her so I decided to make a photo album of cats. I included my fat baby too in the pictures. I think everyone should see these pictures and smile at least once while looking at them!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="challenges"><code>Challenges</code></h2>

<ul>
<li>I had hard time making my photo album responsive. The pictures were getting smaller but they were not changing their locations.</li>

<li>I also had hard time figuring out the layout of my album. I was not sure where to put each section. </li>

<li>I struggled with what to write on this readme file but here we are :) </li>

<li>I overcame my challenges by spending more time on the project and try different things to make it work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goals"><code>Goals</code></h2>

<ul>
<li>My first goal on this project was to show people how amazing the cats are!</li>

<li>My second goal is to practice responsive grid and css tools.I tried to have 3 different layouts and that helped me to understand the grids better.</li>
