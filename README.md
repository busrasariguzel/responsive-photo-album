## `Motivation`

* Cats are human's best friend! Even though they don't show it as much, they love us! Cats make the world a better place! 2 years ago, I adopted a small kitty and my life have changed. Now she is huge(I mean-huge!) and the queen of our life. Since then, I am leaving parties and any social event early to go home and see my little potato. I cannot describe how much I love her so I decided to make a photo album of cats. I included my fat baby too in the pictures. I think everyone should see these pictures and smile at least once while looking at them!

## `Difficulties`
* I had hard time making my photo album responsive. The pictures were getting smaller but they were not changing their locations.
